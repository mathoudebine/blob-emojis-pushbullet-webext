## Credit Where Credit is Due

* Most of the work making this font possible is by eosrei, other than the original artwork (Google), and some third-party open-source code projects eosrei used (for example fonttools, fontforge, python...). I just renamed the Noto SVGs to work with eosrei's tools, and replaced the twemoji SVGs with the Noto ones, and finally edited his build scripts to output a "Noto" ttf file rather than a "twemoji" ttf file.

Thank you eosrei, Google, open source community. You are the real MVP's.
